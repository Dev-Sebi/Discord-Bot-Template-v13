# discord-bot-template-v13
A Simple Discord.js Bot Template for V13.x

## How to use?

- Download the Files and open with your Editor
- Open the Console and do the following:

1. ```npm i```
2. insert your bots Token in the ``.env`` file
3. run ```npm run dev```

The bot should start and you can start developing!
This Template uses [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon), so the bot will automatically restart after a change was made.
